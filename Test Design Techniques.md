I have gathered and summarized information on eleven test design techniques as mentioned on the [TMAP's website.](https://www.tmap.net/building-blocks/test-design-techniques "https://www.tmap.net/building-blocks/test-design-techniques") I hope this knowledge could be beneficial for you, just as it was for me.Â Here you can find the details:

# **How do you choose a test design technique?**

Which technique is most appropriate depends on what exactly you want to test. Following you can see a number of test forms. These test forms, also called quality attributes, are examples of what you can test with a certain system:

1. Functionality
2. Detail functionality
3. Overarching functionality
4. Adaptability, usability, connectivity, performance, or usability

The last form of testing contains a number of elements. That's because most test design techniques that fall under it test multiple things at once.

To give you a clear picture, below we will categorize the eleven design techniques according to the test forms. Under each test form, you'll see which test design techniques can be used.
